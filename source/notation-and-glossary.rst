Notation
========

Unless otherwise noted, in lecture and workshop materials we have tried to use
consistent notation for representing vectors, coordinate systems, and dynamical
variables. This is a brief list of this common notation:

* Vectors: :math:`\bar{x}`
* Time derivatives: :math:`\dot{x} = \frac{{\rm d}x}{{\rm d}t}`
