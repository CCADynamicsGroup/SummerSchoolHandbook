Workshops
=========

All workshop IPython notebooks are available through the `Summer School
Workshops <https://github.com/CCADynamicsGroup/SummerSchoolWorkshops>`__ GitHub
repository. To run the tutorials locally, you can either clone the repository
with ``git`` (this is the recommended method, because it is much easier to
update the notebooks as new content is added using ``git``!), or you can
download a `Zip file with the repository contents
<https://github.com/CCADynamicsGroup/SummerSchoolWorkshops/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`__.
