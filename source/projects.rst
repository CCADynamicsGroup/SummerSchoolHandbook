Research Projects and Goals
===========================

Starting on Monday July 12 through the end of the summer school, each student
will be paired with a set of mentors (possibly in small groups!) to work on
research projects. The project ideas will be shared and introduced during the
first week of the summer school by the mentors.

Throughout the research portion of the summer school, each Friday we will ask
each student to write a short blog post to describe a single plot made during
the week (or a calculation, or discussion points that were raised, etc.): The
blog posts will all be posted on the summer school website.

In the last week of the summer school (August 11â€“12), we will hold a research
symposium where each student will give a presentation about their project.
